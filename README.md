# Intro

* This is a simple problem to help us understand your skills better.

* Ideally it might take around an hour to complete. Yet, feel free to extend further.

* Quality of the solution is more important than faster completing early.

* Post a review of the solution, we might have a one-on-one call to extend it.

* Feel free to ask questions.

* Feel free to use any references and utility packages.

* Feel free to ask for help, if you are stuck.

# Instructions

* The problem consists of multiple steps. Commit the solution for every step in the problem separately. Push every step immediately after completion.

* Create a public git repository and share the URL, before starting development.

* Read and understand the whole problem before writing any code.

# Problem

 Build a simple calculator, following the steps below. Focus on the functionality, not on styling.

## Steps

- Create a simple button with the label '1'. Create a display above the button showing '0'.

- When number-1 is clicked the display should change to 1.

- Create ten buttons for the numbers 0 to 9 and make them behave like number-1. With every button click, the display should show the value of the clicked number.

- Change the behavior of the buttons to allow for a series of inputs to display multiple digits.

- Add a '+' button to allow for the addition of two numbers.

- Add an '=' to update the display with the computed result. IE: The input series '1 + 5 =' should update the display to 6.

- Allow for multiple computations, one after another. IE: '1 + 2 + 4 =' should result in 7.

- Ensure that pressing numbers after pressing '=' resets the display to pressed number. IE: '1 + 1 = ' followed by a '3' should result in 3, not '23'.
